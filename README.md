# Render API Responses in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages

This repository is focused on rendering API responses on Razor Pages in an ASP.NET Core application. The code demonstrates how to integrate frontend logic using Razor Pages to display data fetched from APIs dynamically.

**Objectives**:
After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Combine HTML and C# to define dynamic page rendering logic.
* Render API responses directly within Razor Pages.
* Create pages that perform HTTP operations to interact with APIs.

This repository works in conjunction with the "Implement HTTP Operations
in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages" repository, which handles backend operations 
like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for managing fruit data.

You can check the second module here: [Implement HTTP Operations in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages (GitHub Link)](https://github.com/AlienWashim/Implement-HTTP-Operations-in-ASP.NET-Core-Razor-Pages)
